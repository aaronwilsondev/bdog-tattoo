<h3>How old do you have to be to get tattooed?</h3>
<h4>You must be 18 to get tattooed. No exceptions; Parental permission is not acceptable. If we have any doubts regarding your age, we will ask you for a photo I.D.</h4>

<h3>How old do you have to be to get pierced?</h3>
<h4>The minimum age for each of our piercings can be found on our current pricelist.</h4>

<h3>Do I need to book an appointment?</h3>
<h4>BLDG Tattoo is a custom and appointment based studio, but, subject to availability, we welcome walk-ins on the day. To avoid disappointment, we would advise you to make a booking ahead of time. Waiting time varies for each tattooist.</h4>

<h3>Can I bring my own design to the consultation?</h3>
<h4>In our tattoo studios we welcome pictures, references, ideas and themes and strongly advise you to bring these with you for your consultation so we can get a good idea of the design and style you want.</h4>

<h3>How do I get tattooed at a convention?</h3>
<h4>Details of any convention we’ll be working at will be posted on the blog. Everybody likes to do things slightly differently at conventions, some people take bookings, others take walk ups only. All details will be on the blog or the tattooists personal websites.</h4>

<h3>How much will my tattoo cost?</h3>
<h4>This depends on several factors, including the complexity of the design and the placement of the piece, the level of detail involved, as well as your own stamina. While its possible for us to give estimates over the phone or online, the best way to get an accurate price for a piece is come in and have a chat with us about your design and placement. We can give you some advice, and let you know how long it’s likely to take and how much it will cost – however, this is an approximate quote, so please be prepared for this to change, especially if you make changes to the design or placement on the day.</h4>

<h3>How should I prepare for my appointment?</h3>
<h4>You should get a good night’s rest the night before getting your tattoo or piercing, and should arrive for your appointment on time, and sober. We would advise that you have something to eat before your appointment in order to avoid possible issues with faintness or dizziness. We will not pierce or tattoo anyone who appears to be drunk or stoned and any customers arriving to the studio in this state will be turned away and their deposits forfeit.</h4>

<h3>Can I bring friends with me to my appointment?</h3>
<h4>We have limited space and don’t recommend bringing groups of friends along to your appointment as they can be a distraction for you, your artist and/or other artists and customers. However, in the event that there is space in the tattoo room, if you wish to have one friend present for support, we will allow them to sit quietly with you during your appointment.</h4>

<h3>Can I cancel an appointment, and will I get my deposit back?</h3>
<h4>If you choose to cancel or postpone an appointment please give us as much notice as possible – we require a minimum of 48 hours notice. Deposits for appointments moved or cancelled without minimum notice are forfeit and cannot be refunded or used against another appointment. Deposits will not be refunded if you have receive the artwork from the artists.</h4>
